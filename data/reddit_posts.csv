I am building an AI agent, similar to Github copilot / Cursor but very specialized on data science / ML. It is integrated in VSCode as an extension.

\- Combine different data sources, clean and preprocess for ML pipeline.  
\- Refactor R&D notebooks into ready for production project: Docker, package, tests, documentation.

We are approaching an MVP in the next few weeks and I am hesitating between 2 business models:  
1- Closed source, similar to cursor, with fixed price subscription with limit by request.  
2- Open source, pay per token. User can plug their own API or use our backend which offers all frontier models. Charge a topup % on top of token consumption (similar to Cline).

1lux7bt,Saved $100k per year by explaining how AI/LLM work.,"I work in a data science field, and I bring this up because I think it's data science related.

We have an internal website that is very bare bones. It's made to be simplistic, because it's the reference document for our end-users (1000 of them) use.

Executives heard about a software that would be completely AI driven, build detailed statistical insights, and change the world as they know it.

I had a demo with the company and they explained its RAG capabilities, but mentioned it doesn't really ""learn"" like the assumption AI does. Our repo is so small and not at all needed for AI. We have used a fuzzy search that has worked for the past three years. Additionally, I have already built out dashboards that retrieve all the information executives have asked for via API (who's viewing pages, what are they searching, etc.)

I showed the c-suite executives our current dashboards in Tableau, and how the actual search works. I also explained what RAG is, and how AI/LLMs work at a high level. I explained to them that AI is a fantastic tool, but I'm not sure if we should be spending 100k a year on it. They also asked if I have built any predictive models. I don't think they quite understood what that was as well, because we don't have the amount of data or need to predict anything.

Needless to say, they decided it was best not to move forward ""for now"". I am shocked, but also not, that executives want to change the structure of how my team and end-users digest information just because they heard ""AI is awesome!"" They had zero idea how anything works in our shop.

Oh yeah, our company has already laid of 250 people this year due to ""financial turbulence"", and now they're wanting to spend 100k on this?!

It just goes to show you how deep the AI train runs. Did I handle this correctly and can I put this on my resume? LOL",805,78,2025-07-08T19:03:19+00:00,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1lux7bt/saved_100k_per_year_by_explaining_how_aillm_work/

1lu7gqq,How to deal with time series unbalanced situations?,"**Hi everyone,**

I’m working on a challenge to **predict the probability of a product becoming unavailable the next day**.

The dataset contains one row per product per day, with a binary target (`failure` or not) and 10 additional features. There are over 1 million rows without failure, and only 100 with failure — so it's a highly imbalanced dataset.

Here are some key points I’m considering:

1. **The target should reflect the next day**, not the current one. For example, if product X has data from day 1 to day 10, each row should indicate whether a failure will happen on the following day. Day 10 is used only to label day 9 and is not used as input for prediction.
2. **The features are on different scales**, so I’ll need to apply normalization or standardization depending on the model I choose (e.g., for Logistic Regression or KNN).
3. **There are no missing values**, so I won’t need to worry about imputation.
4. **To avoid data leakage**, I’ll split the data by product, making sure that each product's full time series appears entirely in either the training or test set — never both. For example, if product X has data from day 1 to day 9, those rows must all go to either train **or** test.
5. Since the output should be a **probability**, I’m planning to use models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, or KNN.
6. Due to the strong class imbalance, my **main evaluation metric will be ROC AUC**, since it handles imbalanced datasets well.
7. Would it make sense to include calendar-based features, like the day of the week, weekend indicators, or holidays?
8. How useful would it be to add rolling window statistics (e.g., 3-day averages or standard deviations) to capture recent trends in the attributes?
9. Any best practices for flagging anomalies, such as sudden spikes in certain attributes or values above a specific percentile (like the 90th)?

**My questions:**  
Does this approach make sense?  
I’m not entirely confident about some of these steps, so I’d really appreciate feedback from more experienced data scientists!",54,66,2025-07-07T22:03:11+00:00,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1lu7gqq/how_to_deal_with_time_series_unbalanced_situations/

1lsfyeo,A Brief Guide to UV,"Python has been largely devoid of easy to use environment and package management tooling, with various developers employing their own cocktail of `pip`, `virtualenv`, `poetry`, and `conda` to get the job done. However, it looks like `uv` is rapidly emerging to be a standard in the industry, and I'm super excited about it.

In a nutshell `uv` is like `npm` for Python. It's also written in rust so it's crazy fast.

As new ML approaches and frameworks have emerged around the greater ML space (A2A, MCP, etc) the cumbersome nature of Python environment management has transcended from an annoyance to a major hurdle. This seems to be the major reason `uv` has seen such meteoric adoption, especially in the ML/AI community.

[star history of uv vs poetry vs pip. Of course, github star history isn't necessarily emblematic of adoption.  \<ore importantly, uv is being used all over the shop in high-profile, cutting-edge repos that are governing the way modern software is evolving. Anthropic’s Python repo for MCP uses UV, Google’s Python repo for A2A uses UV, Open-WebUI seems to use UV, and that’s just to name a few.](https://preview.redd.it/b6myln1ve3bf1.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=89d275ad7b050bbe8a365dd731e37910182592c4)

I wrote [an article](https://iaee.substack.com/p/uv-intuitively-and-exhaustively-explained) that goes over `uv` in greater depth, and includes some examples of `uv` in action, but I figured a brief pass would make a decent Reddit post.

**Why UV**  
`uv` allows you to manage dependencies and environments with a single tool, allowing you to create isolated python environments for different projects. While there are a few existing tools in Python to do this, there's one critical feature which makes it groundbreaking: *it's easy to use*.

**Installing UV**  
`uv` can be installed via `curl`

    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

or via `pip`

    pipx install uv

the docs have a [more in-depth guide to install](https://iaee.substack.com/p/uv-intuitively-and-exhaustively-explained#:~:text=Check%20out%20the-,uv%20docs,-for%20more%20information).

**Initializing a Project with UV**  
Once you have `uv` installed, you can run

    uv init

This initializes a uv project within your directory. You can think of this as an isolated python environment that's tied to your project.

**Adding Dependencies to your Project**  
You can add dependencies to your project with

    uv add <dependency name>

You can download all the dependencies you might install via `pip`:

    uv add pandas
    uv add scipy
    uv add numpy sklearn matplotlib

And you can install from various other sources, including github repos, local wheel files, etc.

**Running Within an Environment**  
if you have a python script within your environment, you can run it with

    uv run <file name>

this will run the file with the dependencies and python version specified for this particular environment.  This makes it super easy and convenient to bounce around between different projects. Also, if you clone a `uv` managed project, all dependencies will be installed and synchronized before the file is run.

**My Thoughts**  
I didn't realize I've been waiting for this for a long time. I always found off the cuff quick implementation of Python locally to be a pain, and I think I've been using ephemeral environments like Colab as a crutch to get around this issue. I find local development of Python projects to be significantly more enjoyable with `uv` , and thus I'll likely be adopting it as my go to approach when developing in Python locally.",97,57,2025-07-05T18:01:17+00:00,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1lsfyeo/a_brief_guide_to_uv/

1lqn6pu,How I Use MLflow 3.1 to Bring Observability to Multi-Agent AI Applications,"Hi everyone,

If you've been diving into the world of multi-agent AI applications, you've probably noticed a recurring issue: most tutorials and code examples out there feel like toys. They’re fun to play with, but when it comes to building something reliable and production-ready, they fall short. You run the code, and half the time, the results are unpredictable.

This was exactly the challenge I faced when I started working on enterprise-grade AI applications. I wanted my applications to not only work but also be robust, explainable, and observable. By ""observable,"" I mean being able to monitor what’s happening at every step — the inputs, outputs, errors, and even the thought process of the AI. And ""explainable"" means being able to answer questions like: *Why did the model give this result? What went wrong when it didn’t?*

But here’s the catch: as multi-agent frameworks have become more abstract and convenient to use, they’ve also made it harder to see under the hood. Often, you can’t even tell what prompt was finally sent to the large language model (LLM), let alone why the result wasn’t what you expected.

So, I started looking for tools that could help me monitor and evaluate my AI agents more effectively. That’s when I turned to MLflow. If you’ve worked in machine learning before, you might know MLflow as a model tracking and experimentation tool. But with its latest 3.x release, MLflow has added specialized support for GenAI projects. And trust me, it’s a game-changer.

[MLflow's tracking records. ](https://preview.redd.it/k3i2hbh18naf1.png?width=948&format=png&auto=webp&s=91cd9c33943b0d612fda2e8874b4979c60ce0618)

# Why Observability Matters

Before diving into the details, let’s talk about why this is important. In any AI application, but especially in multi-agent setups, you need three key capabilities:

1. **Observability:** Can you monitor the application in real time? Are there logs or visualizations to see what’s happening at each step?
2. **Explainability:** If something goes wrong, can you figure out why? Can the algorithm explain its decisions?
3. **Traceability:** If results deviate from expectations, can you reproduce the issue and pinpoint its cause?

[Three key metrics for evaluating the stability of enterprise GenAI applications. Image by Author](https://preview.redd.it/azgs0y3j7naf1.png?width=820&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fbf70b52379d8e8e869eab3bb3acc9b9450942f)

Without these, you’re flying blind. And when you’re building enterprise-grade systems where reliability is critical, flying blind isn’t an option.

# How MLflow Helps

MLflow is best known for its model tracking capabilities, but its GenAI features are what really caught my attention. It lets you track everything — from the prompts you send to the LLM to the outputs it generates, even in streaming scenarios where the model responds token by token.

[The Events tab in MLflow interface records every SSE message.](https://preview.redd.it/7mteb23c8naf1.png?width=858&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d0de24b21a58abeca9db0bbc7feeddd106c7fbc)

[MLflow's Autolog can also stitch together streaming messages in the Chat interface.](https://preview.redd.it/h77q9y3h8naf1.png?width=859&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3ab949f1cab02c2d71da952d6b6fc60bb2bac91)

The setup is straightforward. You can annotate your code, use MLflow’s ""autolog"" feature for automatic tracking, or leverage its context managers for more granular control. For example:

* Want to know exactly what prompt was sent to the model? Tracked.
* Want to log the inputs and outputs of every function your agent calls? Done.
* Want to monitor errors or unusual behavior? MLflow makes it easy to capture that too.

[You can view code execution error messages in the Events interface.](https://preview.redd.it/svx0fnpm8naf1.png?width=854&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7edbc819dbbccad8a0e881efce310c4b9553a02)

And the best part? MLflow’s UI makes all this data accessible in a clean, organized way. You can filter, search, and drill down into specific runs or spans (i.e., individual events in your application).

# A Real-World Example

I have a project involving building a workflow using Autogen, a popular multi-agent framework. The system included three agents:

1. A **generator** that creates ideas based on user input.
2. A **reviewer** that evaluates and refines those ideas.
3. A **summarizer** that compiles the final output.

While the framework made it easy to orchestrate these agents, it also abstracted away a lot of the details. At first, everything seemed fine — the agents were producing outputs, and the workflow ran smoothly. But when I looked closer, I realized the summarizer wasn’t getting all the information it needed. The final summaries were vague and uninformative.

With MLflow, I was able to trace the issue step by step. By examining the inputs and outputs at each stage, I discovered that the summarizer wasn’t receiving the generator’s final output. A simple configuration change fixed the problem, but without MLflow, I might never have noticed it.

[I might never have noticed that the agent wasn't passing the right info to the LLM until MLflow helped me out.](https://preview.redd.it/q7giinxu8naf1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=05a3e7c983191836e6ceae8a8f689613d5acf77c)

# Why I’m Sharing This

I’m not here to sell you on MLflow — it’s open source, after all. I’m sharing this because I know how frustrating it can be to feel like you’re stumbling around in the dark when things go wrong. Whether you’re debugging a flaky chatbot or trying to optimize a complex workflow, having the right tools can make all the difference.

If you’re working on multi-agent applications and struggling with observability, I’d encourage you to give MLflow a try.

1lq79vo,"A Breakdown of A2A, MCP, and Agentic Interoperability","MCP and A2A are both emerging standards in AI. In this post I want to cover what they're both useful for (based on my experience) from a practical level, and some of my thoughts about where the two protocols will go moving forward. Both of these protocols are still actively evolving, and I think there's room for interpretation around where they should go moving forward. As a result, I don't think there is a single, correct interpretation of A2A and MCP. These are my thoughts.

**What is MCP?**  
From it's highest level, MCP (model context protocol) is a standard way to expose tools to AI agents. More specifically, it's a standard way to communicate tools to a client which is managing the execution of an LLM within a logical loop. There's not really one, single, god almighty way to feed tools into an LLM, but MCP defines a standard on how tools are defined to make that process more streamlined.

The whole idea of MCP is derivative from LSP (language server protocol), which emerged due to a practical need from programming language and code editor developers. If you're working on something like VS Code, for instance, you don't want to implement hooks for Rust, Python, Java, etc. If you make a new programming language, you don't want to integrate it into vscode, sublime, jetbrains, etc.  The problem of ""connect programming language to text editor, with syntax highlighting and autocomplete"" was abstracted to a generalized problem, and solved with LSP. The idea is that, if you're making a new language, you create an LSP server so that language will work in any text editor. If you're building a new text editor, you can support LSP to automatically support any modern programming language.

[A conceptual diagram of LSPs \(source: MCP IAEE\)](https://preview.redd.it/wz60k2hswiaf1.jpg?width=1050&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c42845286b2bb05047bd0c32caf6a25ca7fdcac)

MCP does something similar, but for agents and tools. The idea is to represent tool use in a standardized way, such developers can put tools in an MCP server, and so developers working on agentic systems can use those tools via a standardized interface.

[LSP and MCP are conceptually similar in terms of their core workflow \(source: MCP IAEE\)](https://preview.redd.it/clc7u0qehiaf1.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=6790f5a438aff994337a2224736ba986f1c17777)

I think it's important to note, MCP presents a standardized **interface** for tools, but there is leeway in terms of how a developer might choose to build tools and resources within an MCP server, and there is leeway around how MCP client developers might choose to use those tools and resources.

MCP has various ""transports"" defined, transports being means of communication between the client and the server. MCP can communicate both over the internet, and over local channels (allowing the MCP client to control local tools like applications or web browsers). In my estimation, the latter is really what MCP was designed for. In theory you can connect with an MCP server hosted on the internet, but MCP is chiefly designed to allow clients to execute a locally defined server.

Here's an example of a simple MCP server:

    """"""A very simple MCP server, which exposes a single very simple tool. In most
    practical applications of MCP, a script like this would be launched by the client,
    then the client can talk with that server to execute tools as needed.
    source: MCP IAEE.
    """"""
    
    from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
    
    mcp = FastMCP(""server"")
    
    u/mcp.tool()
    def say_hello(name: str) -> str:
        """"""Constructs a greeting from a name""""""
        return f""hello {name}, from the server!

In the normal workflow, the MCP client would spawn an MCP server based on a script like this, then would work with that server to execute tools as needed.

**What is A2A?**  
If MCP is designed to expose tools to AI agents, A2A is designed to allow AI agents to talk to one another. I think this diagram summarizes how the two technologies interoperate with on another nicely:

[A conceptual diagram of how A2A and MCP might work together. \(Source: A2A Home Page\)](https://preview.redd.it/gb2bj773ziaf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=c74c1ced5fc1e9026670f68487431392f79d0a4e)

Similarly to MCP, A2A is designed to standardize communication between AI resource. However, A2A is specifically designed for allowing agents to communicate with one another. It does this with two fundamental concepts:

1. Agent Cards: a structure description of what an agent does and where it can be found.
2. Tasks: requests can be sent to an agent, allowing it to execute on tasks via back and forth communication.

A2A is peer-to-peer, asynchronous, and is natively designed to support online communication. In python, A2A is built on top of ASGI (asynchronous server gateway interface), which is the same technology that powers FastAPI and Django.

Here's an example of a simple A2A server:

    from a2a.server.agent_execution import AgentExecutor, RequestContext
    from a2a.server.apps import A2AStarletteApplication
    from a2a.server.request_handlers import DefaultRequestHandler
    from a2a.server.tasks import InMemoryTaskStore
    from a2a.server.events import EventQueue
    from a2a.utils import new_agent_text_message
    from a2a.types import AgentCard, AgentSkill, AgentCapabilities
    
    import uvicorn
    
    class HelloExecutor(AgentExecutor):
        async def execute(self, context: RequestContext, event_queue: EventQueue) -> None:
            # Respond with a static hello message
            event_queue.enqueue_event(new_agent_text_message(""Hello from A2A!""))
    
        async def cancel(self, context: RequestContext, event_queue: EventQueue) -> None:
            pass  # No-op
    
    
    def create_app():
        skill = AgentSkill(
            id=""hello"",
            name=""Hello"",
            description=""Say hello to the world."",
            tags=[""hello"", ""greet""],
            examples=[""hello"", ""hi""]
        )
    
        agent_card = AgentCard(
            name=""HelloWorldAgent"",
            description=""A simple A2A agent that says hello."",
            version=""0.1.0"",
            url=""http://localhost:9000"",
            skills=[skill],
            capabilities=AgentCapabilities(),
            authenticationSchemes=[""public""],
            defaultInputModes=[""text""],
            defaultOutputModes=[""text""],
        )
    
        handler = DefaultRequestHandler(
            agent_executor=HelloExecutor(),
            task_store=InMemoryTaskStore()
        )
    
        app = A2AStarletteApplication(agent_card=agent_card, http_handler=handler)
        return app.build()
    
    
    if __name__ == ""__main__"":
        uvicorn.run(create_app(), host=""127.0.0.1"", port=9000)

Thus A2A has important distinctions from MCP:

* A2A is designed to support ""discoverability"" with agent cards. MCP is designed to be explicitly pointed to.
* A2A is designed for asynchronous communication, allowing for complex implementations of multi-agent workloads working in parallel.
* A2A is designed to be peer-to-peer, rather than having the rigid hierarchy of MCP clients and servers.

**A Point of Friction**  
I think the high level conceptualization around MCP and A2A is pretty solid; MCP is for tools, A2A is for inter-agent communication.

[A high level breakdown of the core usage of MCP and A2A \(source: MCP vs A2A\)](https://preview.redd.it/s8ba9ov6ziaf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c4db19dde15d13cc34372e9c7449ad91939ad28)

Despite the high level clarity, I find these clean distinctions have a tendency to break down practically in terms of implementation. I was working on an example of an application which leveraged both MCP and A2A. I poked around the internet, and found [a repo of examples](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-samples/tree/main/samples/python/agents/a2a_mcp) from the official a2a github account. In these examples, they actually use MCP to expose A2A as a set of tools. So, instead of the two protocols existing independently:

[How MCP and A2A might commonly be conceptualized, within a sample application consisting of a travel agent, a car agent, and an airline agent. \(source: A2A IAEE\)](https://preview.redd.it/5wxavpimniaf1.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=b092517d6df915c72b673898f3bf563f5dda16d0)

Communication over A2A happens within MCP servers:

[Another approach of implementing A2A and MCP. \(source: A2A IAEE\)](https://preview.redd.it/dh3de5xuniaf1.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3f46df060e30bb2d71b24ecfc670566f643322f)

This violates the conventional wisdom I see online of A2A and MCP essentially operating as completely separate and isolated protocols. I think the key benefit of this approach is ease of implementation: You don't have to expose both A2A and MCP as two seperate sets of tools to the LLM. Instead, you can expose only a single MCP server to an LLM (that MCP server containing tools for A2A communication). This makes it much easier to manage the integration of A2A and MCP into a single agent. Many LLM providers have plenty of demos of MCP tool use, so using MCP as a vehicle to serve up A2A is compelling.

You can also use the two protocols in isolation, I imagine. There are a ton of ways MCP and A2A enabled projects can practically be implemented, which leads to closing thoughts on the subject.

**My thoughts on MCP and A2A**  
It doesn't matter how standardized MCP and A2A are; if we can't all agree on the larger structure they exist in, there's no interoperability. In the future I expect frameworks to be built on top of both MCP and A2A to establish and enforce best practices. Once the industry converges on these new frameworks, I think issues of ""should this be behind MCP or A2A"" and ""how should I integrate MCP and A2A into this agent"" will start to go away. This is a standard part of the lifecycle of software development, and we've seen the same thing happen with countless protocols in the past.

Standardizing prompting, though, is a different beast entirely.

Having managed the development of LLM powered applications for a while now, I've found prompt engineering to have an interesting role in the greater product development lifecycle. Non-technical stakeholders have a tendency to flock to prompt engineering as a catch all way to solve any problem, which is totally untrue. Developers have a tendency to disregard prompt engineering as a secondary concern, which is also totally untrue. The fact is, prompt engineering won't magically make an LLM powered application better, but bad prompt engineering sure can make it worse. When you hook into MCP and A2A enabled systems, you are essentially allowing for arbitrary injection of prompts as they are defined in these systems. This may have some security concerns if your code isn't designed in a hardened manner, but more palpably there are massive performance concerns. Simply put, if your prompts aren't synergistic with one another throughout an LLM powered application, you won't get good performance. This seriously undermines the practical utility of MCP and A2A enabling turn-key integration.

I think the problem of a framework to define when a tool should be MCP vs A2A is immediately solvable. In terms of prompt engineering, though, I'm curious if we'll need to build rigid best practices around it, or if we can devise clever systems to make interoperable agents more robust to prompting inconsistencies.

1lpucaf,Need advise on cross-functional collaboration,"Hi data science community,

I need your advice on how to handle a work situation. Curious to know how others would handle or if they have been in a similar situation.

I lead a data science team and I also have a peer who leads a BI team and we report to the same executive.

A couple months ago, BI lead reached out and was excited to see if we can collaborate and create an AI/BI chat bot for our internal structured data. I thought this was a good idea and would be a great opportunity to collaborate with him and his team. So I spent a couple of weeks to build out a POC, I show cased it to him and our executive, it was well received and I outlined next steps on how we can collaborate to make it better.

I got no response from him about my next steps email. I figured no harm no foul he got busy I’m sure. Well come to find out, he had his team build almost an exact replica of the POC I did and essentially boxed my team and I out of this idea and decided he would just do it himself internally. Mind you, all the BI people had to learn how to use LLMs and how to orchestrate agents, etc. it’s a skill set we have but he decided to do it himself despite this.

How would you all handle this?

I was planning on a 1:1 with him where I essentially lay out the facts that he wasted my time by giving me the illusion that we would work together and collaborate but instead just did things himself. We have been getting pushed by our executive team to work together more and this was a great opportunity to show them we work together but instead he decided to take a different route.",18,8,2025-07-02T12:17:58+00:00,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1lpucaf/need_advise_on_crossfunctional_collaboration/
1lpnkj0,"Beta release: Minds AI Filter for EEG — Physics-informed preprocessing for real-time BCI (+17% gain on noisy data from commercial headsets, 0.2s latency)","We at MindsApplied specialize in the development of machine learning models for the enhancement of EEG signal quality and emotional state classification. We're excited to share our latest model—the Minds AI Filter—and would love your feedback.

* [👉 Download the Python package here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_4Q9voe5j88G_EMF8YanoeEPVoUt_D2B?usp=drive_link)
* 🔑Use key: ''REDDIT-KEY-VRG44S' to initialize
* 📄 Includes setup instructions

The Minds AI Filter is a physics-informed, real-time EEG preprocessing tool that relies on sensor fusion for low-latency noise and artifact removal. It's built to improve signal quality before feature extraction or classification, especially for online systems. To dive (very briefly) into the details, it works in part by **reducing high-frequency noise (\~40 Hz) and sharpening low-frequency activity (\~3–7 Hz)**.

We tested it alongside standard bandpass filtering, using both:

* Commercial EEG hardware (OpenBCI Mark IV, BrainBit Dragon)
* The public DEAP dataset, a 32-participant benchmark for emotional state classification

Here are our experimental results:

* Commercial Devices (OpenBCI Mark IV, BrainBit Dragon)
   * \+15% average improvement in balanced accuracy using only 12 trials of 60 seconds per subject per device
   * Improvement attributed to higher baseline noise in these systems
* DEAP Dataset
   * \+6% average improvement across 32 subjects and 32 channels
   * Maximum individual gain: +35%
   * Average gain in classification accuracy was 17% for cases where the filter led to improvement.
   * No decline in accuracy for any participant
* Performance
   * \~0.2 seconds to filter 60 seconds of data

Note: Comparisons were made between bandpass-only and bandpass + Minds AI Filter. Filtering occurred before bandpass.

Methodology:

To generate these experimental results, we used 2-fold stratified cross-validation grid search to tune the filter's key hyperparameter (λ). Classification relied on balanced on balanced accuracy using logistic regression on features derived from wavelet coefficients.

Why we're posting: This filter is still in beta and we'd love feedback —especially if you try it on your own datasets or devices. The current goal is to support rapid, adaptive, and physics-informed filtering for real-time systems and multi-sensor neurotech platforms.

1ln9cf0,Advice on feature selection process,"**Hi everyone,**

I have a question regarding the feature selection process for a credit risk model I'm building as part of my internship. I've collected raw data and conducted feature engineering with the help of a domain expert in credit risk. Now I have a list of around 2000 features.

For the feature selection part, based on what I've learned, the typical approach is to use a tree-based model (like Random Forest or XGBoost) to rank feature importance, and then shortlist it down to about 15–20 features. After that, I would use those selected features to train my final model (CatBoost in this case), perform hyperparameter tuning, and then use that model for inference.

Am I doing it correctly? It feels a bit too straightforward — like once I have the 2000 features, I just plug them into a tree model, get the top features, and that's it. I noticed that some of my colleagues do multiple rounds of feature selection — for example, narrowing it down from 2000 to 200, then to 80, and finally to 20 — using multiple tree models and iterations.

Also, where do SHAP values fit into this process? I usually use SHAP to visualize feature effects in the final model for interpretability, but I'm wondering if it can or should be used during the feature selection stage as well.

I’d really appreciate your advice!",29,19,2025-06-29T08:05:12+00:00,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1ln9cf0/advice_on_feature_selection_process/
1ln8f2b,How do you deal with data scientists with big pay check and title but no domain knowledge?,"A tech illiterate Director at my org hired a data couple of data scientists 18 months ago. He has tasked them with nothing specific. And their job was solely to observe and find uses-cases themselves. The only reason they were hired was for the Director to gain brownie points of creating a data-driven team for themself, despite there being several other such teams.

Cut to today, the Director has realized that there is very little ROI from his hires because they lack domain knowledge. He conveniently moved them to another team where ML is an overkill. The data scientists however, have found some problems they thought they'll solve with ""data science"". They have been vibe coding and building PPTs for months now. But their attempts are hardly successful because of their lack of domain knowledge. To compensate for their lack of domain knowledge, they create beautiful presentations with lots of buzzwords such as LLMs, but again, lack domain substance.

Now, their proposals seem unnecessary and downright obnoxious to many domain SMEs. But the SMEs don't have the courage to say it to the leadership and be percevied as a roadblock to the data-driven strategy. The constant interference of these data scientists is destabilizing the existing processes for the worst and the team is incurring additional costs.

This is a very peculiar situation where the data scientists, lacking domain knowledge, are just shooting project proposals in the dark hoping to hit something. I know this doesn't typically happen in most organizations. But have you ever seen such a situation around you? How did you or others deal with the situation?

EDIT: This post is not to shit on the data scientists. They are probably good in their areas. The problem is not the domain SME support. The problem is that these data scientists seem to be too high on their titles and paychecks to collaborate with SMEs. Most SMEs want to support them and tell them nicely that ML/AI is an overkill for their usecases, and the efforts required are too big.

1ln3zyk,Is ML/AI engineering increasingly becoming less focused on model training and more focused on integrating LLMs to build web apps?,"One thing I've noticed recently is that increasingly, a lot of AI/ML roles seem to be focused on ways to integrate LLMs to build web apps that automate some kind of task, e.g. chatbot with RAG or using agent to automate some task in a consumer-facing software with tools like langchain, llamaindex, Claude, etc. I feel like there's less and less of the ""classical"" ML training and building models.

I am not saying that ""classical"" ML training will go away. I think model building/training non-LLMs will always have some place in data science. But in a way, I feel like ""AI engineering"" seems increasingly converging to something closer to back-end engineering you typically see in full-stack. What I mean is that rather than focusing on building or training models, it seems that the bulk of the work now seems to be about how to take LLMs from model providers like OpenAI and Anthropic, and use it to build some software that automates some work with Langchain/Llamaindex.

Is this a reasonable take? I know we can never predict the future, but the trends I see seem to be increasingly heading towards that.",159,40,2025-06-29T02:35:38+00:00,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1ln3zyk/is_mlai_engineering_increasingly_becoming_less/

1lmneo7,I built a self-hosted Databricks,"Hey everyone, I'm an ML Engineer who spearheaded the adoption of Databricks at work. I love the agency it affords me because I can own projects end-to-end and do everything in one place.

However, the platform adds a lot of overhead and has a wide array of data-features I just don't care about. So many problems can be solved with a simple data pipeline and basic model (e.g. XGBoost.)

1lmi8j8,"The ""Unicorn"" is Dead: A Four-Era History of the Data Scientist Role and Why We're All Engineers Now","Hey everyone,

I’ve been in this field for a while now, starting back when ""Big Data"" was the big buzzword, and I've been thinking a lot about how drastically our roles have changed. It feels like the job description for a ""Data Scientist"" has been rewritten three or four times over. The ""unicorn"" we all talked about a decade ago feels like a fossil today.

I wanted to map out this evolution, partly to make sense of it for myself, but also to see if it resonates with your experiences. I see it as four distinct eras.

---

### **Era 1: The BI & Stats Age (The ""Before Times,"" Pre-2010)**

Remember this? Before ""Data Scientist"" was a thing, we were all in our separate corners.

*   **Who we were:** BI Analysts, Statisticians, Database Admins, Quants.
*   **What we did:** Our world revolved around historical reporting. We lived in SQL, wrestling with relational databases and using tools like Business Objects or good old Excel to build reports. The core question was always, **""What happened last quarter?""**
*   **The ""advanced"" stuff:** If you were a true statistician, maybe you were building logistic regression models in SAS, but that felt very separate from the day-to-day business analytics. It was more academic, less integrated.

The mindset was purely descriptive. We were the historians of the company's data.

### **Era 2: The Golden Age of the ""Unicorn"" (Roughly 2011-2018)**

This is when everything changed. *HBR* called our job the ""sexiest"" of the century, and the hype was real.

*   **The trigger:** Hadoop and Spark made ""Big Data"" accessible, and Python with Scikit-learn became an absolute powerhouse. Suddenly, you could do serious modeling on your own machine.
*   **The mission:** The game changed from ""What happened?"" to **""What's *going* to happen?""** We were all building churn models, recommendation engines, and trying to predict the future. The Jupyter Notebook was our kingdom.
*   **The ""unicorn"" expectation:** This was the peak of the ""full-stack"" ideal. One person was supposed to understand the business, wrangle the data, build the model, and then explain it all in a PowerPoint deck. The *insight* from the model was the final product. It was an incredibly fun, creative, and exploratory time.

### **Era 3: The Industrial Age & The Great Bifurcation (Roughly 2019-2023)**

This is where, in my opinion, the ""unicorn"" myth started to crack. Companies realized a model sitting in a notebook doesn't actually *do* anything for the business. The focus shifted from *building models* to *deploying systems*.

*   **The trigger:** The cloud matured. AWS, GCP, and Azure became the standard, and the discipline of MLOps was born. The problem wasn't ""can we predict it?"" anymore. It was, **""Can we serve these predictions reliably to millions of users with low latency?""**
*   **The splintering:** The generalist ""Data Scientist"" role started to fracture into specialists because no single person could master it all:
    *   **ML Engineers:** The software engineers who actually productionized the models.
    *   **Data Engineers:** The unsung heroes who built the reliable data pipelines with tools like Airflow and dbt.
    *   **Analytics Engineers:** The new role that owned the data modeling layer for BI.
*   The mindset became engineering-first. We were building factories, not just artisanal products.

### **Era 4: The Autonomous Age (2023 - Today and Beyond)**

And then, everything changed again. The arrival of truly powerful LLMs completely upended the landscape.

*   **The trigger:** ChatGPT went public, GPT-4 was released, and frameworks like LangChain gave us the tools to build on top of this new paradigm.
*   **The mission:** The core question has evolved again. It's not just about prediction anymore; it's about **action and orchestration**. The question is, **""How do we build a system that can understand a goal, create a plan, and execute it?""**
*   **The new reality:**
    *   **Prediction becomes a feature, not the product.** An AI *agent* doesn't just predict churn; it takes an *action* to prevent it.
    *   **We are all systems architects now.** We're not just building a model; we're building an intelligent, multi-step workflow. We're integrating vector databases, multiple APIs, and complex reasoning loops.
    *   **The engineering rigor from Era 3 is now the mandatory foundation.** You can't build a reliable agent without solid MLOps and real-time data engineering (Kafka, Flink, etc.).

It feels like the ""science"" part of our job is now less about statistical analysis (AI can do a lot of that for us) and more about the rigorous, empirical science of architecting and evaluating these incredibly complex, often non-deterministic systems.

So, that's my take. The ""Data Scientist"" title isn't dead, but the ""unicorn"" generalist ideal of 2015 certainly is. We've been pushed to become deeper specialists, and for most of us on the building side, that specialty looks a lot more like engineering than anything else.

Curious to hear if this matches up with what you're all seeing in your roles. Did I miss an era? Is your experience different?

EDIT: In response to comments asking if this was written by AI: The underlying ideas are based on my own experience.

1lluwlv,Data Science Has Become a Pseudo-Science,"I’ve been working in data science for the last ten years, both in industry and academia, having pursued a master’s and PhD in Europe. My experience in the industry, overall, has been very positive. I’ve had the opportunity to work with brilliant people on exciting, high-impact projects. Of course, there were the usual high-stress situations, nonsense PowerPoints, and impossible deadlines, but the work largely felt meaningful.

However, over the past two years or so, it feels like the field has taken a sharp turn. Just yesterday, I attended a technical presentation from the analytics team. The project aimed to identify anomalies in a dataset composed of multiple time series, each containing a clear inflection point. The team’s hypothesis was that these trajectories might indicate entities engaged in some sort of fraud.

The team claimed to have solved the task using “generative AI”. They didn’t go into methodological details but presented results that, according to them, were amazing. Curious, nespecially since the project was heading toward deployment, i asked about validation, performance metrics, or baseline comparisons. None were presented.

Later, I found out that “generative AI” meant asking ChatGPT to generate a code. The code simply computed the mean of each series before and after the inflection point, then calculated the z-score of the difference. No model evaluation. No metrics. No baselines. Absolutely no model criticism. Just a naive approach, packaged and executed very, very quickly under the label of generative AI.

The moment I understood the proposed solution, my immediate thought was ""I need to get as far away from this company as possible"". I share this anecdote because it summarizes much of what I’ve witnessed in the field over the past two years. It feels like data science is drifting toward a kind of pseudo-science where we consult a black-box oracle for answers, and questioning its outputs is treated as anti-innovation, while no one really understand how the outputs were generated.

After several experiences like this, I’m seriously considering focusing on academia. Working on projects like these is eroding any hope I have in the field. I know this won’t work and yet, the label generative AI seems to make it unquestionable. So I came here to ask if is this experience shared among other DSs?

1lkpnkk,Pre-Expedition Weather Conditions and Success Rates: Seasonal Pattern Analysis of Himalayan Expedition Data,"After someone posted Himalayan expedition data on Kaggle: [Himalayan Expeditions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/siddharth0935/himalayan-expeditions), I decided to start a personal project and expand on this data by adding ERA5 historical reanalysis weather data to it. Some of my preliminary findings have been interesting so far and I thought I would share them.  
  
I expanded on the expedition data by creating multiple different weather windows:

* Full expedition from basecamp date until termination either following summit or termination of attempt.
* Pre-expedition weather - 14 days prior to official expedition start at basecamp.
* Termination or Summit approach - the day before termination or summit.
* Early phase - the first 14 days at basecamp.
* Late phase - 7 days prior to termination date (either after summit or on failed attempt.)
* Decision window - 2 days prior to summit window

The first weather that I have focused on analyzing is the pre-expedition weather window. After cleaning the data and adding the weather windows, I also added a few other features using simple operations and created a few target variables for later modelling like expedition success score, expedition failure score, and an overall expedition score. For this analysis, though, I only focused on success being either True or False. After creating the features and targets, I then ran t-tests on success being True or False to determine their statistical significance. 

When looking at all the features related to the pre-expedition weather window, the findings seem to suggest that pre-expedition weather conditions play a significant role in Himalayan expedition success or failure in spring/summer expeditions. The graphs and correlation heatmap below summarize the variables that have the highest significance in either success or failure:

Although these findings alone do not paint an over-all picture of Himalayan expedition success or failure, I believe they play a significant part and could be used practically to assess conditions going into spring/summer expeditions.

1ljiuzx,A Breakdown of RAG vs CAG,"I work at a company that does a lot of RAG work, and a lot of our customers have been asking us about CAG. I thought I might break down the difference of the two approaches.

RAG (retrieval augmented generation) Includes the following general steps:

* retrieve context based on a users prompt
* construct an augmented prompt by combining the users question with retrieved context (basically just string formatting)
* generate a response by passing the augmented prompt to the LLM

We know it, we love it. While RAG can get fairly complex (document parsing, different methods of retrieval source assignment, etc), it's conceptually pretty straight forward.

[A conceptual diagram of RAG, from an article I wrote on the subject \(IAEE RAG\).](https://preview.redd.it/izh2zrta0x8f1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=2beb6557c45ffc3221a6d0cda78d5674ffddb487)

CAG, on the other hand, is a bit more complex. It uses the idea of LLM caching to pre-process references such that they can be injected into a language model at minimal cost.

First, you feed the context into the model:

[Feed context into the model. From an article I wrote on CAG \(IAEE CAG\).](https://preview.redd.it/5zw54o9j1x8f1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=27e46efa7ef7a467834558c511954f603b94f224)

Then, you can store the internal representation of the context as a cache, which can then be used to answer a query.

[pre-computed internal representations of context can be saved, allowing the model to more efficiently leverage that data when answering queries. From an article I wrote on CAG \(IAEE CAG\).](https://preview.redd.it/jfznfh2p1x8f1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=da7c17029235ca3fceaa2880a14f095badef9bb3)

So, while the names are similar, CAG really only concerns the augmentation and generation pipeline, not the entire RAG pipeline. If you have a relatively small knowledge base you may be able to cache the entire thing in the context window of an LLM, or you might not.

Personally, I would say CAG is compelling if:

* The context can always be at the beginning of the prompt
* The information presented in the context is static
* The entire context can fit in the context window of the LLM, with room to spare.

Otherwise, I think RAG makes more sense.

If you pass all your chunks through the LLM prior, you can use CAG as caching layer on top of a RAG pipeline, allowing you to get the best of both worlds (admittedly, with increased complexity).

1ljhuda,How to tell the difference between whether managers are embracing reality of AI or buying into hype?,"I work in data science with a skillset that comprises of data science, data engineering and analytics. My team seems to want to eventually make my role completely non-technical (I'm not sure what a non-technical role would entail). The reason is because there's a feeling all the technical aspects will be completely eliminated by AI. The rationale, in theory, makes sense - we focus on the human aspects of our work, which is to develop solutions that can clearly be transferred to a fully technical team or AI to do the job for us. 

The reality in my experience is that this makes a strong assumptions data processes have the capacity to fit cleanly and neatly into something like a written prompt that can easily be given to somebody or AI with no 'context' to develop. I don't feel like in my work, our processes are there yet....like at all. Some things, maybe, but most things no. I also feel I'm navigating a lot of ever evolving priorities, stakeholder needs, conflicting advice (do this, no revert this, do this, rinse, repeat). This is making my job honestly frustrating and burning me out FAST. I'm working 12 hour days, sometimes up to 3 AM. My technical skills are deteriorating and I feel like my mind is becoming into a fried egg. Don't have time or energy to do anything to upskill.

On one hand, I'm not sure if management has a point - if I let go of the 'technical' parts that I like b/c of AI and instead just focus on more of the 'other stuff', would I have more growth, opportunity and salary increase in my career? Or is it better off to have a balance between those skills and the technical aspects? In an ideal world, I want to be able to have a good compromise between subject matter and technical skills and have a job where I get to do a bit of both. I'm not sure if the narrative I'm hearing is one of hype or reality. Would be interested in hearing thoughts.

1lhuk01,I have run DS interviews and wow!,"Hey all,
I have been responsible for technical interviews for a Data Scientist position and the experience was quite surprising to me. I thought some of you may appreciate some insights.

A few disclaimers: I have no previous experience running interviews and have had no training at all so I have just gone with my intuition and any input from the hiring manager. As for my own competencies, I do hold a Master’s degree that I only just graduated from and have no full-time work experience, so I went into this with severe imposter syndrome as I do just holding a DS title myself. But after all, as the only data scientist, I was the most qualified for the task.

For the interviews I was basically just tasked with getting a feeling of the technical skills of the candidates. I decided to write a simple predictive modeling case with no real requirements besides the solution being a notebook. I expected to see some simple solutions that would focus on well-structured modeling and sound generalization. No crazy accuracy or super sophisticated models.

For all interviews the candidate would run through his/her solution from data being loaded to test accuracy. I would then shoot some questions related to the decisions that were made. This is what stood out to me:

1. Very few candidates really knew of other approaches to sorting out missing values than whatever approach they had taken. They also didn’t really know what the pros/cons are of imputing rather than dropping data. Also, only a single candidate could explain why it is problematic to make the imputation before splitting the data.

2. Very few candidates were familiar with the concept of class imbalance.

3. For encoding of categorical variables, most candidates would either know of label or one-hot and no alternatives, they also didn’t know of any potential drawbacks of either one.

4. Not all candidates were familiar with cross-validation

5. For model training very few candidates could really explain how they made their choice on optimization metric, what exactly it measured, or how different ones could be used for different tasks.

Overall the vast majority of candidates had an extremely superficial understanding of ML fundamentals and didn’t really seem to have any sense for their lack of knowledge.
I am not entirely sure what went wrong. My guesses are that either the recruiter that sent candidates my way did a poor job with the screening. Perhaps my expectations are just too unrealistic, however I really hope that is not the case. My best guess is that the Data Scientist title is rapidly being diluted to a state where it is perfectly fine to not really know any ML.
I am not joking - only two candidates could confidently explain all of their decisions to me and demonstrate knowledge of alternative approaches while not leaking data.

Would love to hear some perspectives. Is this a common experience?

1lgfmli,Toolkit to move from junior to senior data analyst (data science track),"I would like to move from data analyst to senior data analyst (SDA) in the next year or so. I have a background in marketing, but pivoted to data science four years ago, and have been learning python since then. Most of my work nowadays is either data wrangling or dashboards, with more senior people doing advanced data science thingies like PCA.

This is a list of tools I think I would need to move from junior data analyst to senior data analyst. Any feedback on if SDA is the right person for these tools is much appreciated.

Extraction
- general pandas read (csv, parquet, json)
- gzip
- iterating through directories
- hosting on AWS / Google Cloud
- various other python packages like sqlite

Wrangling
- cleaning
- merging
- regex / search
- masking
- dtype conversion
- bucketing
- ML preprocessing (hash encoding, standardizing, feature selection)

Segmentation
- PCA / SVD / ICA
- k-means / DBSCAN
- itertools segmentation

Statistics
- descriptive statistics
- AB testing: t tests, ANOVAs, chi squared
- confidence intervals

Machine learning
- model selection
- hyperparameter tuning
- scoring
- inference

Visualization
- EDA visualizations in Jupyter Lab / Colab
- final visualizations in dashboards

Deployment
- deploy and host on AWS / Google Cloud

———

Things I think are simply out of the realm of any DA, senior or not:
- recommendation systems
- neural networks
- setting up an AB test on the back end

1lgdg9j,Has anyone seen research or articles proving that code quality matters in data science projects?,"Hi all,

I'm looking for articles, studies, or real-world examples backed by data that demonstrate the value of code quality specifically in data science projects.

Most of the literature I’ve found focuses on large-scale software projects, where the codebase is big (tens of thousands of lines), the team is large (10+ developers) the expected lifetime of the product is long (10+ years).

Examples: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.04374

In those cases the long-term ROI of clean code and testing is clearly proven. But data science is often different: small teams, high-level languages like Python or R, and project lifespans that can be quite short.

Alternatively, I found interesting recommandations like https://martinfowler.com/articles/is-quality-worth-cost.html (article is old, but recommandations still apply) but without a lot of data backing up the claims.


Has anyone come across evidence (academic or otherwise) showing that investing in code quality, no matter how we define it, pays off in typical data science workflows?

Basically, I work for a tech company with a user-facing product, and we want to build a metric which measures the usability of all our different flows.

I have a good sense of what metrics might represent usability (funnel conversion rate, time, survey scores, etc) but one request made is that the metric must be ""normalized"" (not sure if that's the right word). In other words, the usability score must be comparable across different flows. For example, conversion rate in an ""add payment"" section is always going to be lower than a ""learn about our features"" section - so to prioritize usability efforts we should have a score which accounts for this difference and measures usability on an ""objective"" scale that accounts for the expected gap between different flows.

Does anyone have any experience in building this kind of metric? Are there public analyses or papers I can read up on to understand how to approach this problem, or am I doomed?

1lg5043,Problem identification & specification in Data Science (a metacognitive deep dive),"Hey r/datascience,

I've found that one of the impactful parts of our work is the initial phase of **problem identification and specification**. It's crucial for project success, yet often feels more like an art than a structured science.

I've been thinking about the **metacognition** involved: *how* do we find the right problems, and *how* do we translate them into clear, actionable data science objectives? I'd love to kick off a discussion to gain a more structured understanding of this process.

**Problem Identification**

1. What triggers your initial recognition of a problem that wasn't explicitly assigned?
2. How much is proactive observation versus reacting to a stakeholder's vague need?

**The Interplay of Domain Expertise & Data**

Domain expertise and data go hand-in-hand. Deep domain knowledge can spot issues data alone might miss, while data exploration can reveal patterns demanding domain context.

1. How do these two elements come together in your initial problem framing? Is it sequential or iterative?

**Problem Specification**

1. What critical steps do you take to define a problem clearly?
2. Who are the key players, and what frameworks or tools do you use for nailing down success metrics and scope?

**The ""Systems Model"" of Problem Formulation (A Conceptual Idea)**

This is a bit more abstract, but I'm trying to visualize the process itself. I'm thinking about a 'Systems Model' for problem formulation: *how a problem gets identified and specified*.

If we mapped this process, what would the nodes, edges, and feedback loops look like? Are there common pathways or anti-patterns that lead to poorly defined problems?

\--

I'm curious in how you navigate this foundational aspect of our work. What are your insights into problem identification and specification in data science?

Then, you have document parsing, which is a whole other can of worms, and is usually critical when interfacing with knowledge bases in a regulated industry.

1lfp3ge,Confidence interval width vs training MAPE,"Hi, can anyone with strong background in estimation please help me out here? I am performing price elasticity estimation. I am trying out various levels to calculate elasticities on - calculating elasticity for individual item level, calculating elasticity for each subcategory (after grouping by subcategory) and each category level. The data is very sparse in the lower levels, hence I want to check how reliable the coefficient estimates are at each level, so I am measuring median Confidence interval width and MAPE. at each level. The lower the category, the lower the number of samples in each group for which we are calculating an elasticity. Now, the confidence interval width is decreasing for it as we go for higher grouping level i.e. more number of different types of items in each group, but training mape is increasing with group size/grouping level. So much so, if we compute a single elasticity for all items (containing all sorts of items) without any grouping, I am getting the lowest confidence interval width but high mape.

But what I am confused by is - shouldn't a lower confidence interval width indicate a more precise fit and hence a better training MAPE? I know that the CI width is decreasing because sample size is increasing for larger group size, but so should the residual variance and balance out the CI width, right (because larger group contains many type of items with high variance in price behaviour)? And if the residual variance due to difference between different type of items within the group is unable to balance out the effect of the increased sample size, doesn't it indicate that the inter item variability within different types of items isn't significant enough for us to benefit from modelling them separately and we should compute a single elasticity for all items (which doesn't make sense from common sense pov)?",9,8,2025-06-19T23:20:01+00:00,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1lfp3ge/confidence_interval_width_vs_training_mape/

I get the business value of making predictions under a range of possible futures, but it feels like this would have to be the last step after several:

1. Thorough exploration of your data to understand feature-level relationships. If you change something about a feature that's correlated with other features you need to be able to model that.

2. Just having a working predictive model. We don't have any actual models in production yet. An EDA would be part of this as well, accomplishing step 1.

3. Then scenario planning is something you can use simulations for assuming you have enough to work with in 1 and 2.

My other thought has been to explore what approaches causal inference and things like DAGs might offer. Not where my background is, but it sounds like the company wants to make casual statements so it seems worth considering.

1ld06j0,"The Illusion of ""The Illusion of Thinking""","Recently, Apple released a paper called ""The Illusion of Thinking"", which suggested that LLMs may not be reasoning at all, but rather are pattern matching:

[https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06941](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06941)

A few days later, A paper written by two authors (one of them being the LLM Claude Opus model) released a paper called ""The Illusion of the Illusion of thinking"", which heavily criticised the paper.

[https://arxiv.org/html/2506.09250v1](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.09250v1)

A major issue of ""The Illusion of Thinking"" paper was that the authors asked LLMs to do excessively tedious and sometimes impossible tasks; citing The ""Illusion of the Illusion of thinking"" paper:

>Shojaee et al.’s results demonstrate that models cannot output more tokens than their context limits allow, that programmatic evaluation can miss both model capabilities and puzzle impossibilities, and that solution length poorly predicts problem difficulty. These are valuable engineering insights, but they do not support claims about fundamental reasoning limitations.

>Future work should:

>1. Design evaluations that distinguish between reasoning capability and output constraints

>2. Verify puzzle solvability before evaluating model performance

>3. Use complexity metrics that reflect computational difficulty, not just solution length

>4. Consider multiple solution representations to separate algorithmic understanding from execution

>The question isn’t whether LRMs can reason, but whether our evaluations can distinguish reasoning from typing.

This might seem like a silly throw away moment in AI research, an off the cuff paper being quickly torn down, but I don't think that's the case. I think what we're seeing is the growing pains of an industry as it begins to define what reasoning actually is.

This is relevant to application developers, not just researchers. AI powered products are significantly difficult to evaluate, often because it can be very difficult to define what ""performant"" actually means.

(I wrote this, it focuses on RAG but covers evaluation strategies generally. I work for EyeLevel)

1lcemw6,"Don’t be the data scientist who’s in love with models, be the one who solves real problems","work at a company with around 100 data scientists, ML and data engineers.

The most frustrating part of working with many data scientists and honestly, I see this on this sub all the time too, is how obsessed some folks are with using ML or whatever the latest SoTA causal inference technique is. Earlier in my career plus during my masters, I was exactly the same, so I get it.

But here’s the best advice I can give you: **don’t be that person.**

Unless you’re literally working on a product where ML is the core feature, **your job is basically being an internal consultant.** That means understanding what stakeholders actually want, challenging their assumptions when needed, and giving them something useful, not just something that will disappear into a slide deck or notebook. 

Always try and make something run in production, don’t do endless proof of concepts. If you’re doing deep dives / analysis, define success criteria of your initiatives, try and measure them (e.g., some of my less technical but awesome DS colleagues made their career of finding drivers of key KPIs, reporting them to key stakeholders and measuring improvement over time). In short, **prove you’re worth it**.

A lot of the time, that means building a dashboard. Or doing proper data/software engineering. Or using GenAI. Or whatever else some of my colleagues (and a loads of people on this sub) roll their eyes at.

Solve the problem. Use whatever gets the job done, not just whatever looks cool on a résumé.",844,99,2025-06-15T23:52:42+00:00,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1lcemw6/dont_be_the_data_scientist_whos_in_love_with/

1l8xqgf,Data scientists need to know about data contracts.,"Data contracts are these things that data engineers write to set up expectations of what the data looks like.

And who understands the expectations better than a data engineer? A data scientist with context about how the business works.

…But, most of us aren’t gonna write YAML files and glue contracts into pipelines.

We don’t do that kind of dirty job…

Still, if you want to stop data quality issues from showing up and impacting your machine learning models, contracts can still be the way to go.

Why? Because a good data contract connects two worlds:

• The business context you understand.

• The technical realities your team builds on.

Stuck in a vicious circle of misplaced expectations from stakeholders being agreed for delivery by PMs even without consulting DS to begin with.

So, that expectation functions like a feature in a front end application in the mind of a Product Manager - deterministic mode (not sure if it is agile or waterfall type of project management or whatever).

DS tries to do what is best possible but it falls short of what stakeholders expect - they literally say we thought some magic would happen through advanced data science!

PM now tries to do RCA to understand where things went wrong while continuing to play gallery to stakeholders unquestioningly. PM has difficulty understanding DS stuff and keeps telling to keep things non-technical while asking questions that are inherently technical! PM is more comfortable looking at data viz, React applications etc.

DS is to blame for not creating magic.

Meanwhile, users have other problems that could be solved by DA or DS but they lie unutilized because they are attached to Excel and Excel Macros. Not willing to share relevant domain inputs.

1. Assumptions make it or break it - with RDD more than ever
2. LATE might be not what we need, but it'll be what we get
3. RDD and instrumental variables have lots in common. At least both are very ""elegant"".
4. Sprinkle covariates into your model very, very delicately or you'll do more harm than good
5. Never lose track of the question you're trying to answer, and never pick it up if it did not matter to begin with

I get it; you really can't imagine how you're going to read straight on for 40 minutes; no worries, you don't have to.

She takes her plan off to the owner who says he wants to start off with 1 BI report done in 35 hours as a test run as a sort of feasibility thing. I do up a solid report in 32 hours. Ops manager loves it. General manager likes it. Owner thinks I missed the mark. Damn. His feedback is that he doesn't like that he has to filter to get some of the information. He'd like pieces of it to be readily available and visible without having to click anything. I take this feedback and quickly add cards with the wanted measures. Not good enough, now he wants to see more without having to filter. Oh also, he wants all the info to be on one page and all viewable without having to scroll. I tried to tell him that's not the best way to use power BI multiple times, but he just kinda brushed me off and kept moving along every time. We get to a point where he's finally happy with this report. Now he wants to see the small approach we agreed upon applied to a new report so he can verify it from scratch without me needing to take more time to implement feedback after. So I get a new report to work on, and only 20 hours this time. It's an easier data set, so I'm able to blast through it pretty quick and I do it up with his own requested measures shown prominently all on one page, with some visuals for some more complex relationships. Nope. Somehow this one isn't good enough either, but now they have this document that they just keep adding little requests to. I've gone at this thing like 4 or 5 times now. It'll be good, so we move on to the next phase, but then I somehow miss the mark on that and have to go back to the first phase and incorporate new measures?!?!?

Now he keeps giving me these tiny 3 hour micro contracts and moving the goal posts while dangling a longer contract in front of me at the end of a long stick. It's gotten to the point that literally everything on the page is being fed by a measure so that he doesn't have to filter. Am I overreacting and is this a normal use of power BI? They're paying me dog shit too (bottom 1% for my area). I feel like telling them to all fuck off, but I need to navigate things appropriately so that it doesn't negatively impact my fiancée. I'm feeling massively disrespected and played, though. I feel like it goes against everything I've learned about the tool. I'm trying to be cooperative so I can land this contract while also trying to avoid being taken advantage of because I'm a new grad. 

Oh! Also, this dude said to the ops manager that he thought I was going to use up any extra safety time he gives me because I just want the hours. This is after I saved 3 hours on my first sprint and 6 hours on my second sprint. I don't understand what his issue is. Ops manager thinks he should just give me a solid contract but keeps making excuses for why we should just try one more time to meet his unrealistic wants. 

Typing all this out has helped me realize just how much I'm being screwed. I'm going to post it anyway cause I still want other people's feedback, but yeah, I see how spineless I'm being. It's just hard to walk away when I could really use the contract that they keep dangling, but I don't think it's ever coming.

Sorry if this reads like a scatterbrained mess of words. I'm just kinda shot gunning my thoughts out. Anything constructive you can offer is appreciated.

I am a ""old"" data scientists looking to renew my stacks. Looking for opinions on what is the best IDE in 2025.   
The other discussion I found was 1 year ago and some even older. 

So what do you use as IDE for data science (data extraction, cleaning, modeling to deployment)? What do you like and what you don't like about it? 

Currently, I am using JupyterLab:  
**What I like:**  
\- Native compatible with notebook, I still find notebook the right format to explore and share results  
\- %magic command  
\- Widget and compatible with all sorts of dataviz (plotly, etc)  
\- Export in HTML

**What I feel missing (but I wonder whether it is mostly because I don't know how to use it):**  
\- Debugging  
\- Autocomplete doesn't seems to work most of the time.   
\- Tree view of file and folder  
\- Comment out block of code ? (I remember it used to work but I don't know why it don't work anymore)  
\- Great integration of AI like Github Copilot

This is something myself and a few others have mentioned here however I find that this discussion still doesn't occur enough.

I'm in a position and have been for the last few years where I get to define the hiring pipeline.

Generally speaking, I pay way more attention to what someone has been doing for the last 4 years than what they have a degree in. If someone studied a BS in geoscience then did predictive analytics for GIS and environmental services and I just happen to be working at a financial firm that's interested in environment / services then when it comes to that person or the guy with a PhD in Industrial Engineering I'm taking the BS in geoscience.

Same thing in a less niche space, if I'm looking for someone who can come up with initiatives and drive them with business leaders then I'm generally looking for someone who did analytics at a supply chain / distribution company because they know how to stand up for themself, they're willing to work more / take ownership, etc.

It doesn't matter if you got an MS from Stanford if you do compliance analytics or data governance at a bank, you're now less desirable for many applied data science positions. This being said, many smaller companies are now getting to the point where they need data governance and there is a space for you to be a leader there.

I'm a recent MS Statistics graduate (Fall '24), who just finished undergrad (Spring '23) with no working and internship experience. Fortunately, I was able to land a data analyst position at a nonprofit company in March this year, but I am kind of missing the hands-on modeling (Bayesian Statistics, Econometrics, ML, Statistical Regression) and theoretical math (stochastic calculus/processes, ML, probability, Real Analysis) during my master's program.

I understand that given my lack of experience and entry level position, I am very luck to have a job, especially in this economy. However, I also do harbor disappointment in my outcomes, as I did apply for \~1000 jobs, and had more than 40 interviews for all types of positions (quant, data scientist, model validation analyst, data analyst, etc.) this year, but was beat out by people who probably have more relevant experience and technical skills.

I am thinking of applying this Fall/beginning of next year for some more modeling-heavy positions, but I am also wondering whether given the current economy and my unproven track record, I should realistically lower my expectations and evaluate other options (personal projects to sharpen my skills, PhD in a STEM field, working on a research project), and what I should focus on with my projects to improve myself as a candidate (domain knowledge, sound coding skills, implementation of new models).

1l10fes,How I scraped 4.1 million jobs with GPT4o-mini,"**Background**: During my PhD in Data Science at Stanford, I got sick and tired of ghost jobs & 3rd party offshore agencies on LinkedIn & Indeed. So I wrote a script that fetches jobs from 100k+ company websites' career pages and uses GPT4o-mini to extract relevant information (ex salary, remote, etc.) from job descriptions. I made it publicly available here [https://hiring.cafe](https://hiring.cafe) and you can follow my progress and give me feedback at r/hiringcafe

**Tech details (from a DS perspective)**

1. Verifying legit companies. This I did manually, but it was crucial that I exclude any recruiting firms, 3rd party offshore agencies, etc. I manually sorted through the \~100,000 company career pages (this took several weeks) and picked the ones that looked legit. At Stanford, we call this technique ""occular regression"" :) 
2. Removing ghost jobs. I discovered that a strong predictor of if a job is a ghost job is that if it keeps being reposted. I was able to identify reposting by doing a embedding text similarity search for jobs from the same company. If 2 job descriptions overlap too much, I only show the date posted for the *earliest* listing. This allowed me to weed out most ghost jobs simply by using a date filter (for example, excluding any jobs posted over a month ago). 
3. Scraping fresh jobs 3x/day. To ensure that my database is reflective of the company career page, I check each company career page 3x/day. To avoid rate-limits, I used a rotating proxy from Oxylabs for now.
4. Building advanced NLP text filters. After playing with GPT4o-mini API, I realized I could can effectively dump raw job descriptions (in HTML) and ask it to give me back formatted information back in JSON (ex salary, yoe, etc). I used this technique to extract a variety of information, including technical keywords, job industry, required licenses & security clearance, if the company sponsors visa, etc.

**Question for the DS community:** Beyond job search, one thing I'm really excited about this 4.1 million job dataset is to be able to do a yearly or quarterly trend report. For instance, to look at what technical skills are growing in demand. What kinds of cool job trends analyses would you do if you had access to this data.

**Edit:** A few folks DMed asking to explore the data for job searching. I put together a minimal frontend to make the scraped jobs searchable: [https://hiring.cafe](https://hiring.cafe) — note that it's currently non-commercial, unsupported, just a PhD side-project at the moment until I gradute.

**Edit 2::** thank you for all the super positive comments. you can follow my progress on scraping more jobs on r/hiringcafe .Aalso to comments saying this is an ad, my full-time job is my phd, this is just a fun side project beofore I get an actual job haha",539,67,2025-06-01T21:27:39+00:00,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1l10fes/how_i_scraped_41_million_jobs_with_gpt4omini/
1l0y4zo,Advice on processing ~1M jobs/month with LLaMA for cost savings,"I'm using GPT-4o-mini to process \~1 million jobs/month. It's doing things like deduplication, classification, title normalization, and enrichment.

This setup is fast and easy, but the cost is starting to hurt. I'm considering distilling this pipeline into an open-source LLM, like LLaMA 3 or Mistral, to reduce inference costs, most likely self-hosted on GPU on Google Coud. 

Questions:

\* Has anyone done a similar migration? What were your real-world cost savings (e.g., from GPT-4o to self-hosted LLaMA/Mistral)

\* Any recommended distillation workflows? I'd be fine using GPT-4o to fine-tune an open model on our own tasks.

\* Are there best practices for reducing inference costs even further (e.g., batching, quantization, routing tasks through smaller models first)?

\* Is anyone running LLM inference on consumer GPUs for light-to-medium workloads successfully?

Right now, our GPT-4o-mini usage is costing me thousands/month (I'm paying for it out of pocket, no investors). Would love to hear what’s worked for others!

1kzkwcg,Validation of Statistical Tooling Packages,"Hey all,

I was wondering if anyone has any experience on how to properly validating statistical packages for numerical accuracy?

Some context: I've developed a Python package for internal use that can undertake all the statistics we require in our field for our company. The statistics are used to ensure compliance to regulatory guidelines. 

The industry standard is a globally shared maceo-free Excel sheet, that relies heavily on approximations to bypass VBA requirements. Because of this, edge cases will give different reaults. Examples include use of non-central t-distrubtion, MLE, infinite series calcuations, Shapiro-wilk. The sheet is also limited to 50 samples as the approximations end here.

Packages exist in R that do most of it (NADA, EnvStats, STAND, Tolerance). I could (and probably should have) make a package from these, but I'd still need to modify and develop some statistics from scratch, and my R skills are abysmal compared to Python.

From a software engineering point, for more math heavy code, is there best practices for validating the outputs? The issue is this Excel sheet is considered the ""gold standard"" and I'll need to justify differences.

I currently have two validation passes, one is a dedicated unit test with a small dataset that I have cross referenced and checked by hand, with exisiting R packages and with the existing notebook. This dataset I've picked tries to cover extremes at either side of the data ranges we get (Geo standard deviations > 5, massive skews, zero range, heavily censored datasets).

The second is a bulk run of a large datatset to tease out weird edge cases, but I haven't done the cross validations by hand unless I notice weird results.

Is there anything else that I should be doing, or need to consider?",13,6,2025-05-31T01:12:57+00:00,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1kzkwcg/validation_of_statistical_tooling_packages/
1kzjr30,Two‑stage model filter for web‑scale document triage?,"I am crawling roughly **20 billion** web pages, and trying to triage for the ones that are only job descriptions. Only about **5%** contain actual job advertisements. Running a Transformer over the whole corpus feels prohibitively expensive, so I am debating whether a **two‑stage pipeline** is the right move:

1. **Stage 1:** ultra‑cheap lexical model (hashing TF‑IDF plus Naive Bayes or logistic regression) on CPUs to toss out the obviously non‑job pages while keeping recall very high.
2. **Stage 2:** small fine‑tuned Transformer such as DistilBERT on a much smaller candidate pool to recover precision.

My questions for teams that have done large‑scale extraction or classification:

* Does the two‑stage approach really save enough money and wall‑clock time to justify the engineering complexity compared with just scaling out a single Transformer model on lots of GPUs?
* Any unexpected pitfalls with maintaining two models in production, feature drift between stages, or tokenization bottlenecks?
* If you tried both single‑stage and two‑stage setups, how did total cost per billion documents compare?
* Would you recommend any open‑source libraries or managed services that made the cascade easier?

I generated data y=2+5x+eps, eps~N(0, 5) and I fit a model y=mx+b (so I fit the same model family as was used for data generation). Somehow ridge regression still fits better than OLS.

I run 10k experiments with 5 training and 5 testing data points. OLS achieved mean MSE 42.74, median MSE 31.79. Ridge with alpha=5 achieved mean MSE 40.56 and median 31.51.

I cannot comprehend how it's possible - I seemingly introduce bias without an upside because I shouldn't be able to overfit. What is going on? Is it some Stein's paradox type of deal? Is there a counterexample where unregularized model would perform better than model with any ridge_alpha?

Edit: well of course this is due to small sample and large error variance. That's not my question. I'm not looking for a ""this is a bias-variance tradeoff"" answer either. Im asking for intuition (proof?) why would a biased model ever work better in such case. Penalizing high b instead of high m would also introduce a bias but it won't lower the test error. But penalizing high m does lower the error. Why?",49,33,2025-05-30T00:44:23+00:00,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1kyr1va/regularizationmagic/

1ky9jlz,Seeking help in choosing between two offers.,"Hey Y'all,

Needed some inputs in choosing between two offers. I have tried to read similar thread before. 

**Company 1**: Some Fintech

**Position**: Senior Data Scientist

**Role**: Taking care of their models on databricks. Models like ARR modelling. Churn modelling etc.

**Other Important Factors**: Company 1 has 5 days in office. This is a new mandate to prevent previous misuse. You also have to be very social person. They have had rounds of layoffs and had hiring freeze and have started to hiring again. My interview experience was great and I can see myself being successful in this role. However, I havent practiced classic machine learning for a while. I surely can pick it up. I am only worried that this role will have no engineering work at all. No productionsining of models. I am not sure how this will be for my future roles.



**Company 2**: Some company which is actively using LLMs and Agentic approaches

**Position**: Senior Machine Learning Engineer

**Role**: Work with agentic AI and productionise and update LLMs

**My Preference** \- Work with a company with stability and in a position where I can grow long term.


**Other Important Factors**: This role is in line with my last role, my PhD and LLM experience. I have read tonnes of literature so I sort of feel prepared for this role but I feel worthless when I have to spend weeks to improve latency without touching LLMs. My technical round was also okayish in this company. They are doubling the team. They are a well established company too. 


-------------------------------

My last position was of a ML engineer and I think what I disliked is -- the position slowly slipping into too much backend work. I am a stronger data scientist by training but have a PhD in NLP application so know the other bit too. I do struggle a bit when it comes to productinising things but I have improved a lot and in a better place.

I guess what I want to ask is for folks who work at companies that have not yet implemented AI -- do you feel behind the industry or you have satisfied with the current trajectory ?

I honestly don't care about whether I work in NLP / AI or not, All I want is a peaceful job where I can do my best and grow. On one hand the ML engineer position seems to be very on the cutting edge of technology but I know at the end its going to be API call to some LLM with much boiler plate code and many tools. The data scientist position looks like something I have done in the past and now should leave and do progress to ML engineering.

1kvzd73,Thinking of switching from Data Scientist to Data Product Owner — need advice,"Hey everyone,
I’ve been working as a Data Scientist for the past 5 years, currently at a bank. I’ll be honest — this might sound a bit harsh, but it’s just how I personally feel: this job is slowly draining me.

Most of the models I build never make it to production. A big chunk of my time is spent doing analysis that feels more like trying to impress higher-ups than solving real problems. And with AI evolving so rapidly, there’s this growing pressure to “level up” to a senior role — but the bar is so high now, and the opportunities seem fewer and harder to reach. It’s honestly demotivating.

So, I’m thinking about pivoting into a Data Product Owner (or Product Manager) role. I feel like my experience could bridge the gap between business and technical teams — I can speak the language of data engineers, ML engineers, and data scientists. Plus, I’d love to be in a role that’s more collaborative and human-facing. It also feels like a safer long-term path in this AI-driven world.

Has anyone made a similar transition? Or is anyone here feeling the same way? I’d really appreciate any advice, feedback, or even just hearing your story. Totally open to different perspectives.

Thanks!

Guys I’m currently doing a 2 years Master in Business Analytics (Management + Data Science), but I’m considering switching to a Master in CS and ML. The downside is that I’d lose a year.

With Business Analytics, I can access roles like:
- Data Scientist (but nowadays Data Scientists mostly do Product Analytics rather than ML, which doesn’t excite me)
- Management roles (but in tech it means mainly Sales, Marketing… less interesting to me. The exception is PM but it is very hard as a graduate)

So my questions are:

1) Does it make sense to lose a year to switch to CS+ML? My biggest fear is how AI is evolving and impacting the field. **This is the biggest fear i have, should i switch in the era of AI?**

1ksvnsk,"""You will help build and deploy scalable solutions... not just prototypes""","Hi everyone,

I’m not exactly sure how to frame this, but I’d like to kick off a discussion that’s been on my mind lately.

I keep seeing data science job descriptions *(E2E) data science,* not just prototypes, but scalable, production-ready solutions. At the same time, they’re asking for an overwhelming tech stack: DL, LLMs, computer vision, etc. On top of that, E2E implies a whole software engineering stack too.

So, what does *E2E* really mean?

For me, the ""left end"" is talking to stakeholders and/or working with the WH. The ""right end"" is delivering three pickle files: one with the model, one with transformations, and one with feature selection. Sometimes, this turns into an API and gets deployed sometimes not. This assumes the data is already clean and available in a single table. Otherwise, you’ve got another automated ETL step to handle. (Just to note: I’ve never had write access to the warehouse. The best I’ve had is an S3 bucket.)

When people say “scalable deployment,” what does that really mean? Let’s say the above API predicts a value based on daily readings. In my view, the model runs daily, stores the outputs in another table in the warehouse, and that gets picked up by the business or an app. Is that considered scalable? If not, what is?

If the data volume is massive, then you’d need parallelism, Lambdas, or something similar. But is that my job? I could do it if I had to, but in a business setting, I’d expect a software  engineer to handle that.

Now, if the model is deployed on the edge, where exactly is the “end” of E2E then?

Some job descriptions also mention API ingestion, dbt, Airflow, basically full-on data engineering responsibilities.

The bottom line: Sometimes I read a JD and what it *really* says is:

“We want you to talk to stakeholders, figure out their problem, find and ingest the data, store it in an optimized medallion-model warehouse using dbt for daily ingestion and Airflow for monitoring. Then build a model, deploy it to 10,000 devices, monitor it for drift, and make sure the pipeline never breaks.

Meanwhile, in real life, I spend weeks hand-holding stakeholders, begging data engineers for read access to a table I should already have access to, and struggling to get an EC2 instance when my model takes more than a few hours to run. Eventually, we store the outputs after  more meetings with the DE.

Often, the stakeholder sees the prototype, gets excited, and then has no idea how to use it. The model ends up in limbo between the data team and the business until it’s forgotten. It just  feels like the ego boost of the week for the C guys.

Now, I’m not the fastest or the smartest. But when I try to do all this E2E in personal projects, it takes ages and that’s without micromanagers breathing down my neck. Just setting up ingestion and figuring out how to optimize the WH took me two weeks.

So... all I am asking am I stupid , am I missing something?  Do you all actually do all of this daily? Is my understanding off?

Really just hoping this kicks off a genuine discussion.

1ksev5p,Is the traditional Data Scientist role dying out?,"I've been casually browsing job postings lately just to stay informed about the market, and honestly, I'm starting to wonder if the classic ""Data Scientist"" position is becoming a thing of the past.

* Data Analyst/BI roles (lots of SQL, dashboards, basic reporting)
* Data Engineer positions (pipelines, ETL, infrastructure stuff)
* AI/ML Engineer jobs (but these seem more about LLMs and deploying models than actually building them)

What I'm *not* seeing much of anymore is that traditional data scientist role - you know, the one where you actually do statistical modeling, design experiments, and work through complex business problems from start to finish using both programming and solid stats knowledge.

It makes me wonder: are companies just splitting up what used to be one data scientist job into multiple specialized roles? Or has the market just moved on from needing that ""unicorn"" profile that could do everything?

For those of you currently working as data scientists - what does your actual day-to-day look like? Are you still doing the traditional DS work, or has your role evolved into something more specialized?

And for anyone else who's been keeping an eye on the job market - am I just looking in the wrong places, or are others seeing this same trend?

You simply write out the likelihood of observing the data {(x\_i, y\_i) | i=1, ..., N}, given that the target variable y\_i came from a normal distribution with mean f(x\_i). Then you take the negative log of this, differentiate it with respect to the parameter(s), w in this case, set it equal to zero, and solve for w. This is all basic and makes sense to me; you are finding the w which maximizes the likelihood of observing the data you saw, given the assumption that the data y\_i was drawn from a normal distribution with mean f(x\_i) for each i.

What gets me confused is using a more complex model and loss function, like LightGBM with a Tweedie loss. I figured the exact same principles would apply, but when I try to wrap my head around it, it seems I'm missing something.

In the linear regression example, the ""model"" is y\_i \~ N(f(x\_i), sigma\^2). In other words, you are assuming that the response variable y\_i is a linear function of the independent variable x\_i, plus normally distributed errors. But how do you even write this in the case of LightGBM with Tweedie loss? In my head, the analogous ""model"" would be y\_i \~ Tw(f(x\_i), phi, p), where f(x\_i) is the output of the LightGBM algorithm, and f(x\_i) takes the place of the mean mu in the Tweedie distribution Tw(u, phi, p). Is this correct? Are we always just treating the prediction f(x\_i) as the mean of the distribution we've assumed, or is that only coincidentally true in the special case of a linear model with normal distribution NLL?",7,3,2025-05-21T00:55:46+00:00,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1krl7kx/question_about_using_the_mle_of_a_distribution_as/

1kowb8p,Prediction flow with Gaussian distributed features,"Hi all,
Just recently started as a data scientist, so I thought I could use the wisdom of this subreddit before I get up to speed and compare methodologies to see what can help my team better.
 
So say I have a dataset for a classification problem with several features (not all) that are normally distributed, and for the sake of numerical stability I’m normalizing those values to their respective Z-values (using the training set’s means and std to prevent leakage).

Now after I train the model and get some results I’m happy with using the test set (that was normalized also with the training’s mean and std), we trigger some of our tests and deploy pipelines (whatever they are) and later on we’ll use that model in production with new unseen data. 

My question is, what is your most popular go to choice to store those mean and std values for when you’ll need to normalize the unseen data’s features prior to the prediction? The same question applies for filling null values.

“Simplest” thing I thought of (with an emphasis on the “”) is a wrapper class that stores all those values as member fields along with the actual model object (or pickle file path) and storing that class also with pickle, but it sounds a bit cumbersome, so maybe you can spread some light with more efficient ideas :)

1kkwjla,"""Day Since Last X"" feature preprocessing","Hi Everyone! Bit of a technical modeling question here. Apologies if this is very basic preprocessing stuff but I'm a younger data scientist working in industry and I'm still learning.

  
Say you have a pretty standard binary classification model predicting 1 = we should market to this customer and 0 = we should not market to this customer (the exact labeling scheme is a bit proprietary). 

I have a few features that are in the style ""days since last touchpoint"". For example ""days since we last emailed this person"" or ""days since we last sold to this person"". However, a solid percentage of the rows are NULL, meaning we have never emailed or sold to this person. Any thoughts on how should I handle NULLs for this type of column? I've been imputing with MAX(days since we last sold to this person) + 1 but I'm starting to think that could be confusing my model. I think the reality of the situation is that someone with 1 purchase a long time ago is **a lot** more likely to purchase today than someone who has never purchased anything at all. The person with 0 purchases may not even be interested in our product, while we have evidence that the person with 1 purchase a long time ago is at least a fit for our product. Imputing with MAX(days since we last sold to this person) + 1 poses these two cases as very similar to the model.

For reference I'm testing with several tree-based models (light GBM and random forest) and comparing metrics to pick between the architecture options. So far I've been getting the best results with light GBM.

One thing I'm thinking about is whether I should just leave the people who have never sold as NULLs and have my model pick the direction to split for missing values. (I believe this would work with LightGBM but not RandomForest).

Another option is to break down the ""days since last sale"" feature into categories, maybe quantiles with a special category for NULLS, and then dummy encode.

Has anyone else used these types of ""days since last touchpoint"" features in propensity modeling/marketing modeling?",29,16,2025-05-12T16:13:47+00:00,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1kkwjla/day_since_last_x_feature_preprocessing/

1ki9zo3,Client told me MS Copilot replicated what I built. It didn’t.,"I built three MVP models for a client over 12 weeks. Nothing fancy: an LSTM, a prophet model, and XGBoost. The difficulty, as usual, was getting and understanding the data and cleaning it. The company is largely data illiterate. Turned in all 3 models, they loved it then all of a sudden canceled the pending contract to move them to production. Why? They had a devops person do in MS Copilot Analyst (a new specialized version of MS Copilot studio) and it took them 1 week! Would I like to sign a lesser contract to advise this person though? I finally looked at their code and it’s 40 lines of code using a subset of the California housing dataset run using a Random Forest regressor. They had literally nothing.

1khu4f8,This is how I got a (potential) offer revoked: A learning lesson,"I’m based in the Bay Area with 5 YOE. A couple of months ago, I interviewed for a role I wasn’t too excited about, but the pay was super compelling. In the first recruiter call, they asked for my salary expectations. I asked for their range, as an example here, let’s say they said $150K–$180K. I said, “That works, I’m looking for something above $150K.” I think this was my first mistake, more on that later.

I am a person with low self esteem(or serious imposter syndrome) and when I say I nailed all 8 rounds, I really must believe that. The recruiter followed up the day after 8th round saying team is interested in extending an offer. Then on compensation expectations the recruiter said, “You mentioned $150K earlier.” I clarified that I was targeting the upper end based on my fit and experience. They responded with, “So $180K?” and I just said yes. It felt a bit like putting words in my mouth.

Next day, I got an email saying that I have to wait for the offer decision as they are interviewing  other candidates. Haven’t heard back since. I don’t think I did anything fundamentally wrong or if I should have regrets but curious what others think.

Edit: Just to clarify, in my mind I thought that’s how negotiations work. They will come back and say can’t do 150 but can do 140. But I guess not.",243,124,2025-05-08T16:16:55+00:00,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1khu4f8/this_is_how_i_got_a_potential_offer_revoked_a/
1khkkv8,"Code is shit, business wants to scale, what could go wrong?","A bit of context. I have taken charge of a project recently. It's a product in a client facing app. The implementation of the ML system is messy. The data pipelines consists of many sql codes. These codes contain rather complicated business knowledge. There is airflow that schedules them, so there is observability. 

This code has been used to run experiments for the past 2 months. I don't know how much firefighting has been going on. But in the past week that I picked up the project, I spent 3 days on firefighting. 

I understand that, at least theoretically, when scaling, everything that could go wrong goes wrong. But I want to hear real life experiences. When facing such issues, what have you done that worked? Could you find a way to fix code while helping with scaling? Did firefightings get in the way? Any past experience would help. Thanks!

1khic8u,The worst thing about being a Data Scientist is that the best you can do you sometimes is not even nearly enough,"This specially sucks as a consultant. You get hired because some guy from Sales department of the consulting company convinced the client that they would give them a Data Scientist consultant that would solve all their problems and build perfect Machine Learning models. 


Then you join the client and quickly realize that is literary impossible to do any meaningful work with the poor data and the unjustified expectations they have. 

As an ethical worker, you work hard and to everything that is possible with the data at hand (and maybe some external data you magically gathered). You use everything that you know and don't know, take some time to study the state of the art, chat with some LLMs on their ideas for the project, run hundreds of different experiments (should I use different sets of features? Should I log transform some numerical features? Should I apply PCA? How many ML algorithms should I try?) 

And at the end of day... The model still sucks. You overfit the hell of the model, makes a gigantic boosting model with max_depth  set as 1000, and you still don't match the dumb manager expectations. 

I don't know how common that it is in other professions, but an intrinsic thing of working in Data Science is that you are never sure that your work will eventually turn out to be something good, no matter how hard you try.

I am a strong believer in technical expertise, meaning that a DS needs to know what is doing. You cannot improvise ML expertise when it comes to bring stuff into production.

Nevertheless, I think those kind of challenges works only if you're a monkey-coder that recently worked on that exact stuff, and specifically practiced for those challenges. No way that I know by heart all the subtle nuances of SQL or edge cases in ML, but on the other hand I'm most certainly able to solve those issues in real life projects.

1kgsn61,Am I or my PMs crazy? - Unknown unknowns.,"My company wants to develop a product that detects ""unknown unknowns"" it a complex system, in an unsupervised manner, in order to identify new issues before they even begin. I think this is an ill-defined task, and I think what they actually want is a supervised, not unsupervised ML pipeline. But they refuse to commit to the idea of a ""loss function"" in the system, because ""anything could be an interesting novelty in our system"". 

The system produces thousands of time series monitoring metrics. They want to stream all these metrics through anomaly detection model. Right now, the model throws thousands of anomalies, almost all of them meaningless. I think this is expected, because statistical anomalies don't have much to do with *actionable events.* Even more broadly **I think unsupervised learning cannot ever produce business value.** You always need some sort of supervised wrapper around it.

What PMs want to do: flag all outliers in the system, because they are potential problems

What I think we should be doing: (1) define the ""health (loss) function"" in the system (2) whenever the health function degrades look for root causes / predictors / correlates of the issues (3) find patterns in the system degradation - find *unknown* causes of *known* adverse system states

Hi everyone, I wanted to share this open-source product for data portals with the Data Science community. Appreciate your attention!

**Our mission:**

Open data publishing shouldn’t be hard. We want local governments, academics, and NGOs to treat publishing their data like any other SaaS subscription: sign up, upload, update, and go.

**Why PortalJS?**

- Small teams need a simple, affordable way to get their data out there.
- Existing platforms are either extremely expensive or require a technical team to set up and maintain.
- Scaling an open data portal usually means dedicating an entire engineering department—and we believe that shouldn’t be the case.

1kerpax,How would you architect this?,"I work for a startup where the main product is a sales meeting analyser. Naturally there are a ton of features that require audio and video processing, like diarization, ASR, video classification, etc…

The CEO is in cost savings mode and he wants to reduce our compute costs. Currently our ML pipeline is built on top of kubernetes and we always have at least on gpu machine up per task (T4s and L4s) per day and we dont have a lot of clients, meaning most of the time the gpus are idle and we are paying for them. I suggested moving those tasks to cloud functions that use GPUs, since we are using GCP and they have recently came out with that feature, but the CEO wants to use gemini to replace these tasks since we will most likely be on the free tier.

The problems I see is that once we leave the free tier the costs will be more than 10x our current costs and that there are downstream ML tasks that depend on these, so changing the input distribution is not really a good idea… for example, we have a text classifier that was trained with text from whisper - changing it to gemini does not seem to be a good idea to me…

he claimed he wants it to be maintainable so an api request makes more sense to him, but the reason why he wants it to be maintainable is because a lot of ML people are leaving (mainly because of his wrong decisions and micro management - is this another of his wrong decisions?)

using gemini to do asr and diarization, for example, just feels way way wrong",9,8,2025-05-04T19:09:35+00:00,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1kerpax/how_would_you_architect_this/

Even when the dataset itself is reliable, which is rare, there’s almost always something fundamentally broken in the methodology. God help me, if I see one more SHAP summary plot treated like it's the Rosetta Stone of model behavior, I might lose it. Even causal ML approaches where I had hoped we might find some solid approaches are messy, for example transfer entropy alone can be computed in 50 different ways and bottom line the closer we get to the actual truth the closer we get to Landau´s limit, finding the “truth” requires so much effort that it's practically inaccessible...The worst part is almost no one has time to write critical reviews, so applied ML papers keep getting published, cited, and used to justify decisions in policy and science...Please, if you're working in ML interpretability, keep writing thoughtful critical reviews, we're in real need of more careful work to help sort out this growing mess.

These vignettes simulate the types of decisions nurses  must make every day, particularly in low-resource environments where access to specialists or diagnostic equipment may be limited.

1kapczj,"What is the best way to parse and order a PDF from forum screenshots that includes a lot of cached text, quotes, random order and overall a mess.","Hello dear people! Been dealing with this very interesting problem that I'm not 100% sure how to tackle. A local forum went down some time ago and they lost a few hours worth of data since backups aren't hourly. Quite a few topics were lost, as well as some of them apparently became corrupted and also got lost. One of them included a very nice discussion about local mountaineering and beautiful locations which a lot of people are saddened to lost since we discussed many trails. Somehow, people managed to collect data from various cached sources, computers, some screenshots, but mostly old google, bing caches while they worked and webarchive. 

Now it's all properly ordered in pdf document but the thing is the layouts often change and so does resolution but the general idea of how data is represented is the same. There's also some artifacts in data from webarchive for example - they have an element hovering over text and you can't see it, but if you ctrl-f to search for it it's there somehow, hidden under the image haha. No javascript in PDF, something else, probably  colored, no idea.

The ideas I had were (btw PDF is OCR'd already):

&nbsp;

- PDF to text and try to regex + LLM process it all somehow?

- Somehow ""train"" (if train is a proper word here?) machine vision / machine learning for each separate layout so that it knows how to extract data

&nbsp;

But I also face issue that some posts are for example screenshoted in ""half"", e.g. page 360 has the text cut out and continue on page 361 with random stuff on top from the archival's page (e.g. webarchive or bing cache info). I would need to also truncate this, but that should be easy.

- Or option 3 with those new LLMs that can somehow recognize images or work with PDF (idk how they do it) I could maybe have the LLM do the whole heavy load of processing? I could pick up one of better new models with big context length and remembrance, I just checked total character count, it's 8.588.362 characters or 2.147.090 tokens approximately, but I believe the data could be split and later manually combined or something? I'm not sure I'm really new to this. The main goal is to have a nice json output with all data properly curated.

1kanby4,The role of data science in the age of GenAI,"I've been working in the space of ML for around 10 years now. I have a stats background, and when I started I was mostly training regression models on tabular data, or the occasional tf-idf + SVM pipeline for text classification. Nowadays, I work mainly with unstructured data and for the majority of problems my company is facing, calling a pre-trained LLM through an API is both sufficient and the most cost-effective solution - even deploying a small BERT-based classifier costs more and requires data labeling. I know this is not the case for all companies, but it's becoming very common.

Over the years, I've developed software engineering skills, and these days my work revolves around infra-as-code, CI/CD pipelines and API integration with ML applications. Although these skills are valuable, it's far away from data science.

For those who are in the same boat as me (and I know there are many), I'm curious to know how you apply and maintain your data science skills in this age of GenAI?

1kaki1s,is it data leakage?,"We are predicting conversion. Conversion means customer converted from paying one-off to paying regular (subscribe)

If one feature is categorical feature ""Activity"" , consisting 15+ categories and one of the category is ""conversion"" (labelling whether the customer converted or not). The other 14 categories are various. Examples are emails, newsletter, acquisition, etc. they're companies recorded of how it got this customers (no matter it's one-off or regular customer) It may or may not be converted customers

so we definitely cannot use the one category as a feature in our model otherwise it would create data leakage. What about the other 14 categories?

What if i create dummy variables from these 15 categories + and select just 2-3 to help modelling? Would it still create leakage ?

I asked this to 1. my professor 2. A professional data analyst They gave different answers. Can anyone help adding some more ideas?

I tried using the whole features (convert it to dummy and drop 1), it helps the model. For random forests, the top one with high feature importance is this Activity\_conversion (dummy of activity - conversion) feature

1k8hjp4,This environment would be a real nightmare for me.,"YouTube released some interesting metrics for their 20 year celebration and their data environment is just insane.

- Processing infrastructure handling 20+ million daily video uploads 
- Storage and retrieval systems managing 20+ billion total videos
- Analytics pipelines tracking 3.5+ billion daily likes and 100+ million daily comments
- Real-time processing of engagement metrics (creator-hearted comments reaching 10 million daily)
- Infrastructure supporting multimodal data types (video, audio, comments, metadata)

From an analytics point of view, it would be extremely difficult to validate anything you build in this environment, especially if it's something that is very obscure. 
Supposed they calculate a ""Content Stickiness Factor"" (a metric which quantifies how much a video prevents users from leaving the platform), 
how would anyone validate that a factor of 0.3 is correct for creator X? That is just for 1 creator in one segment, there are different segments which all have different behaviors eg podcasts which might be longer vs shorts

I would assume training ml models, or basic queries would be either slow or very expensive which punishes mistakes a lot. You either run 10 computer for 10 days or or 2000 computers for 1.5 hours, and if you forget that 2000 computer cluster running, for just a few minutes for lunch maybe, or worse over the weekend, you will come back to regret it.

Any mistakes you do are amplified by the amount of data, you omitting a single ""LIMIT 10"" or use a ""SELECT * "" in the wrong place and you could easy cost the company millions of dollars.
""Forgot a single cluster running, well you just lost us $10 million dollars buddy""

And because of these challenges, l believe such an environment demands excellence, not to ensure that no one makes mistakes, but to prevent obvious ones and reduce the probability of catastrophic ones.

l am very curious how such an environment is managed and would love to see it someday.

1k89ohp,People here working in Healthcare how do you communicate with Healthcare professionals?,"I'm pursuing my doctoral deg in data science. My domain is ai in Healthcare. We collab with a hospital from where I get my data. In return im practically at their beck and call. They expect me analyze some of their data and automate a few tasks. Not a big deal when I have to build a model it's usually a simple classification model where I use ml models or do some transfer learning. The problem is communicating the feature selection/extraction process. I don't need that many features for the given number of data points. 

How do I explain to them that even if clinically those two features are the most important for the diagnosis I still have to scrape one of them. It's too correlated(>0.9) and is only adding noise. And I do ask them to give me more variable data and they can't. They insist I do dimensionality reduction but then I end up with lower accuracy. I don't understand why people think ai is intuitive or will know things that we humans don't. It can only perform based on the data given.

1k87wnq,Thoughts on getting a Masters while working as a DS?,"I entered DS straight after an undergrad in Computer Science. During my degree I did multiple DS internships and an ML research internship. I figured out I didn't like research so a PhD was out. I couldn't afford to stay on for a Masters so I went straight into work and found a DS role, where I'm performing very well and getting promoted quickly.

I like my current org but it's a very narrow field of work so I might want to move on in 2-3 years. I see a lot of postings (both internally and externally) require a Masters, so I'm wondering if I'm putting myself at a disadvantage by not having one.

My current employer has tuition reimbursement up to ~$6k a year so I was thinking of doing a part-time Masters (something like OMSCS, OMSA, or a statistics MS program offered by a local uni) - partially for the signalling of having a Masters, and partially because I just really love learning and I feel like the learning has stagnated in my current role... 

On the other hand I'm worried that doing a Masters alongside work will impact my ability to focus on my job & progression plans. I've already done two Masters courses part-time (free, credit-bearing but can't transfer them to a degree) and found it ok but any of the degrees I've been considering would be much more workload. 

Another option would be to take a year out between jobs and do a Masters, but with the job market the way it is that feels like a big risk.

Now every ML/DS internship description looks like:  
""Must know full-stack development, backend, frontend, cloud engineering, DevOps, machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and also invent a new programming language while you're at it.""

Bro I just wanted to do some modeling, not rebuild Twitter from scratch..

I know basic stuff like SDLC, Git, and cloud fundamentals, but I honestly have no clue about real frontend/backend development. Now I’m thinking I need to buckle down and properly learn SWE if I ever want to land an ML/DS internship.

First, am I wrong for thinking this way? Is full-stack knowledge pretty much required now for ML/DS intern roles, or am I just applying to cracked job posts?  
Second, if I do need to learn SWE properly, where should I start?

I don't want to sit through super basic ""hello world"" courses (no offense to IBM/Meta Coursera certs, but I need something a little more serious). I heard the Amazon Junior Developer program on Coursera might be good? Anyone tried it?

I was recently talking to someone at a technical meet-up for working professionals and one person was saying some really weird stuff. It was like they had heard of the technical terms before, but didn't actually have the experience working with the technologies/skills. For example, they mentioned that they had ""All sorts of experience with Kafka"" but didn't know that it is a tool that Data Engineers and related professionals could use for their workflows. They also mixed up the definitions of common machine learning models, what said models could do for a business, NoSQL & SQL, etc. It was jarring.

Also, sometimes I get the impression that a minority of people on this subreddit come on and lie about ever having a Data Science job.

I do want to say that I do not believe that all Data Scientists need to know Kafka (or any other specific tech. I don't know a bunch of stuff). I brought up the Kafka example because it was the most egregious (the person claimed to have all these years of experience, but didn't know a bunch of stuff including the basics). The conversation was 35 minutes, so I only wanted to bring up the outliers/notable examples.

And I want to emphasize that I was talking about **all** Data Science jobs (Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Architect, etc.).

I've put together a few projects that combine general programming, ML implementation, and basic data analysis. And overall, I quite like python and it really hasn't been too difficult to pick up. And the few times I've run into an issue, I've generally blamed it on R (e.g . the day I learned about mutable objects was a frustrating one). However, basic analysis - like summary stats - feels impossible.

All this time I've heard Python users hype up pandas. But now that I am actually learning it, I can't help think why? Simple aggregations and other tasks require so much code. But more confusng is the syntax, which seems to be odds with itself at times.  Sometimes we put the column name in the parentheses of a function, other times be but the column name in brackets before the function. Sometimes we call the function normally (e.g.mean()), other times it is contain by quotations. The whole thing reminds me of the Angostura bitters bottle story, where one of the brothers designed the bottles and the other designed the label without talking to one another.

1k33k6t,Finally releasing the Bambu Timelapse Dataset – open video data for print‑failure ML (sorry for the delay!),"Hey everyone!

I know it’s been a **long minute** since my original call‑for‑clips – life got hectic and the project had to sit on the back burner a bit longer than I’d hoped. 😅 Thanks for bearing with me!

# What’s new?

* **The dataset is live** on Hugging Face and ready for download or contribution.
* **First models are on the way** (starting with **build‑plate identification**) – but I can’t promise an exact release timeline yet. Life still throws curveballs!

🔗 **Dataset page:** [https://huggingface.co/datasets/v2thegreat/bambu-timelapse-dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/v2thegreat/bambu-timelapse-dataset)

# What’s inside?

* **627 timelapse videos** from P1/X1 printers
* **81 full‑length camera recordings** straight off the printer cam
* Thumbnails + CSV metadata for quick indexing
* CC‑BY‑4.0 license – free for hobby, research, and even commercial use with proper attribution

# Why bother?

* It’s the **first fully open corpus** of Bambu timelapses; most prior failure‑detection work never shares raw data.
* Bambu Lab printers are everywhere, so the footage mirrors real‑world conditions.
* Great sandbox for manufacturing / QA projects—failure classification, anomaly detection, build‑plate detection, and more.

# Contribute your clips

1. Open a **Pull Request** on the repo (`originals/timelapses/<your_id>/`).
2. If PRs aren’t your jam, DM me and we’ll arrange a transfer link.
3. Please crop or blur anything private; aim for bed‑only views.

# Skill level

If you know some Python and basic ML, this is a perfect **intermediate** project to dive into computer vision. Total beginners can still poke around with the sample code, but training solid models will take a bit of experience.

1k32lrl,"Python users, which R packages do you use, if any?","I'm currently writing an R package called [rixpress](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rixpress) which aims to set up reproducible pipelines with simple R code by using Nix as the underlying build tool. Because it uses Nix as the build tool, it is also possible to write targets that are built using Python.
[Here is an example of a pipeline that mixes R and Python.](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rixpress_demos/blob/master/python_r/gen-pipeline.R)

I think rixpress can be quite useful to Python users as well (and I might even translate the package to Python in the future), and I'm looking for examples of Python users that need to also work with certain R packages. These examples would help me make sure that passing objects from and between the two languages can be as seamless as possible.

So Python data scientists, which R packages do you use, if any?

1k2u4nd,Leverage Points for a Design Matrix with Mainly Categorial Features,"Hello! I hope this is a stupid question and gets quickly resolved. As per title, I have a design matrix with a high amount of categorial features. I am applying a linear regression model on the data set (mainly for training myself to get familiarity with linear regression). The model has a high amount of categorial features that I have one-hot encoded.

Now I try to figure out high leverage points for the design matrix. After a couple of attempts I was wondering if that would even make sense and how to evaluate if determining high leverage points would generally make sense in this scenario.

After asking ChatGPT (which provided a weird answer I know is incorrect) and searching a bit I found nothing explaining this. So, I thought I come here and ask:

* In how far does it make sense to compute/check for leverage values given that there is a high amount of categorial features?
* How to compute them? Would I use the diagonal of the HAT matrix or is there eventually another technique?

  
I am happy about any advise or hint, explanation or approach that gives me some clarity in this scenario. Thank you!!

I have seen this means that a lot of DS work is now instead handed to SWEs, and the 'modelling' is all a GPT/API call.

Maybe this is just a feature of my company and the way they look at their tech stack, but I feel that DS is not getting as many projects and things are going to the SWEs only, as they can quickly build, and rapidly deploy into product.

I want to better learn how to integrate GenAI features/apps in our JavaScript based product, so that I can also build and integrate, and build working PoCs, rather than being trapped in notebooks. 

I'm not sure if I should just learn raw JS, because I'd even want to know how to put things into a silent test as an example, where predictions are made but no prediction is shown to the user.

I need some advice. I have an MsC in Data Science and have really struggled to find jobs. I got an average paying, “data science adjacent but not data science enough” quantitative analyst job in a bank. In fact , I feel like I get dumber every day I’m there and I’m miserable. None of the skills or achievements there are noteworthy : no model building, no big analyses, no data engineering or Gen ai work, just model validation work (helping other people fix their modeling solutions).

Long story short, I’m interviewing for a fellowship position to be a data engineer in a nonprofit. It lasts for one year and exposes me to many clients that I will aid. At most I can extend the fellowship for one additional year. It sounds exciting. It pays 10K less, but it’s a step in the right direction. It gets me closer to what I actually studied.

The reason I write this post is because I want to know if it will negatively impact my resume or future chances. If I take this job, my resume will look like this : data analyst job (3 years) with a bit of sql and excel, two data science internships (one 3 months and one 8 months) at the university, quantitative analyst (6months), data engineer fellowship (1 year). Will this make companies look at me like a problem and not give me a chance to even interview? Thanks in advance, everybody.

1k0zcye,Data Engineer trying to understand data science to provide better support.,"I work as a data engineer who mainly builds & maintains data warehouses but now I’m starting to get projects assigned to me asking me to build custom data pipelines for various data science projects and I’m assuming deployment of Data Science/ML models to production. 

Since my background is data engineering, how can I learn data science in a structured bottom up manner so that I can best understand what exactly the data scientists want? 

This may sound like overkill to some but so far the data scientist I’m working with is trying to build a data science model that requires enriched historical data for the training of the data science model. Ok no problem so far. 

However, they then want to run the data science model on the data as it’s collected (before enrichment) but the problem is this data science model is trained on enriched historical data that wont have the exact same schema as the data that’s being collected real time?

What’s even more confusing is some data scientists have said this is ok and some said it isn’t.

I don’t know which person is right. So, I’d rather learn at least the basics, preferably through some good books & projects so that I can understand when the data scientists are asking for something unreasonable.

I need to be able to easily speak the language of data scientists so I can provide better support and let them know when there’s an issue with the data that may effect their data science model in unexpected ways.

1k0vdku,Quick question regarding nested resampling and model selection workflow,"EDIT!!!!!! Post wording is confusing, when I refer to models I mean one singular model tuned N number of ways. E.g. random Forrest tuned to 4 different depths would be model a,b,c,d in my diagram.

Just wanted some feedback regarding my model selection approach.

The premise:  
Need to train dev a model and I will need to perform nested resmapling to prevent against spatial and temporal leakage.  
Outer samples will handle spatial leakage.  
Inner samples will handle temporal leakage.  
I will also be tuning a model.

Via the diagram below, my model tuning and selection will be as follows:  
\-Make inital 70/30 data budget  
\-Perfrom some number of spatial resamples (4 shown here)  
\-For each spatial resample (1-4), I will make N (4 shown) spatial splits  
\-For each inner time sample i will train and test N (4 shown) models and mark their perfromance  
\-For each outer samples' inner samples - one winner model will be selected based on some criteria  
\--e.g Model A out performs all models trained innner samples 1-4 for outer sample #1  
\----Outer/spatial #1 -- winner model A  
\----Outer/spatial #2 -- winner model D  
\----Outer/spatial #3 -- winner model C  
\----Outer/spatial #4 -- winner model A  
\-I take each winner from the previous step and train them on their entire train sets and validate on their test sets  
\--e.g train model A on outer #1 train and test on outer #1 test  
\----- train model D on outer #2 train and test on outer #2 test  
\----- and so on  
\-From this step the model the perfroms the best is then selected from these 4 and then trained on the entire inital 70% train and evalauated on the inital 30% holdout.

Should I change my method up at all?  
I was thinking that I might be adding bias in to the second modeling step (training the winning models on the outer/spatial samples) because there could be differences in the spatial samples themselves.   
Potentially some really bad data ends up exclusively in the test set for one of the outer folds and by default make one of the models not be selected that otherwise might have.
